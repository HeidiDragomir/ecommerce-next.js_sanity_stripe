## My first webshop and my first contact with Sanity and Stripe

This project is done using this tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxXyfkrP298&t=40572s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxXyfkrP298&t=40572s) in order to learn Next.js, to test Sanity for backend and Stripe for payments.

You can check the live version here: [https://ecommerce-next-js-sanity-stripe.vercel.app/](https://ecommerce-next-js-sanity-stripe.vercel.app/)

The webshop is fully functional and completely responsive.

I want to develop it later, too add more functionality, but I preffer to focus on learning something new.
