## My first webshop and my first contact with Sanity and Stripe

This project was done using a tutorial in order to learn Next.js, to test Sanity for backend and Stripe for payments.

You can check the live version here: [https://ecommerce-next-js-sanity-stripe.vercel.app/](https://ecommerce-next-js-sanity-stripe.vercel.app/)

The webshop is fully functional and completely responsive.

I want to develop it later, too add more functionality.
